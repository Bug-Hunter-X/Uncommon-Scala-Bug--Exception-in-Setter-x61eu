# Uncommon Scala Bug: Exception in Setter

This repository demonstrates an uncommon Scala bug related to using a private `var` with a setter that throws an exception. This can lead to unexpected behavior. The code provides a simple example of the issue and also shows how to work around this problem by using either try-catch blocks or a more robust way of handling the exception.
